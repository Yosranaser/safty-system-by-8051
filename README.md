This project is a Safety  system in a factory
Project features:
 1- we ‘ve LM32 temperature sensor which sense environment temperature and send it to the LCD ( as an application on ADC).
2- we ‘ve an ultrasonic sensor which measure the distance between the worker and the machine and when it is less than 9cm led will be on which will indicate that the is a danger .(( as an application on Timer module)).
3- it’s not allowed to everyone to enter the factory so it’s must for every worker to enter general password which is known between them(( as an application on Interrupt)).
